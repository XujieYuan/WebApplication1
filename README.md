"Composting and Recycling promise a better Future"

# Project Aim
The average household garbage bin in Victoria contains around 50% organic matter mostly food and green waste. 
New migrant parents with young kids who arrive in Victoria are unaware of handing green waste.
And they may feel confused about Australia's composting waste recycling. 
Hence, they want to deal with their daily composting waste based on the Australia composting policy.
Our project will provide users with information on composting and garbage collection to help them understand the composting process and garbage classification methods.
